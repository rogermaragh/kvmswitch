üíª kvmswitch (C++) - Unleash Your Workspace Potential


üåü Highlights
High-Performance Software KVM: Leveraging the power of C++ for responsive and efficient input management.
Virtual KVM Functionality: Control multiple computers from a single Keyboard, Video (Monitor), and Mouse (KVM) console.
Optimized for System Interaction: C++ allows for granular control over input devices and operating system APIs.
Reduced Clutter & Cost: A software-based approach potentially replaces bulky hardware KVM switches. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: A Robust Software KVM Solution
The kvmswitch project is a C++ application designed to provide a high-performance, software-based KVM solution. It allows you to control multiple computers seamlessly using just one keyboard, mouse, and monitor, similar to how traditional hardware KVM switches operate. By utilizing C++, this project delves deep into system-level interactions to efficiently capture and redirect input signals, offering a smooth and responsive experience. It's an ideal solution for developers, power users, or anyone managing multiple machines who wishes to enhance productivity and declutter their workspace without the need for additional hardware. 

üöÄ Usage
Requirements
Operating System: Windows (or potentially other platforms if designed to be cross-platform, but this README focuses on a Windows implementation given the context).
C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW, MSVC) and development environment.
Physical Connections: The core KVM switch functionality relies on connecting your keyboard, mouse, and monitor to the computer running this kvmswitch software. The software then manages switching control to other target computers, says Share Mouse. 
Building the Project
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/rogermaragh/kvmswitch.git
Use code with caution.

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd kvmswitch
Use code with caution.

Compile the source code:
(This is a general example. Specific build instructions will depend on the project's structure, build system like Makefiles, CMake, or an IDE project file like .vcxproj for Visual Studio. Adapt these steps as needed.)
bash
# Example for a simple C++ compilation (Windows with g++):
g++ -o kvmswitch.exe main.cpp -luser32 -lgdi32 # Add other necessary libraries
Use code with caution.

Or, if using a build system like CMake:
bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
Use code with caution.

Execution
Once compiled, run the executable:
bash
kvmswitch.exe
Use code with caution.

Configuration: The program will likely provide a method to define the target computers it can switch to. This might involve a configuration file, command-line arguments, or a graphical user interface (if developed).
Switching Control: The application will offer a mechanism, such as user-defined hotkeys or a UI element, to switch control of your shared keyboard, mouse, and potentially monitor output to the desired target computer seamlessly. You can then interact with the selected computer as if your peripherals were directly connected. 

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality: Deep Dive into C++ Implementation
Leveraging C++, this project likely interacts directly with the Windows API (or equivalent APIs on other platforms) for precise control over input and output. Key areas of implementation may include:
Low-Level Input Hooks: Utilizing Windows API hooks (SetWindowsHookEx) to intercept keyboard and mouse input events before they reach applications.
Input Simulation: Employing functions like SendInput to inject synthesized input events (keyboard presses, mouse movements, clicks) into the target system's input stream.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Mechanisms (e.g., named pipes, sockets, shared memory) for communicating between the kvmswitch application and the target computers to facilitate the switching.
Networking: Using sockets for transmitting input events and potentially other control signals over the network to the target machines.
Window Management: Using functions like FindWindow, SetForegroundWindow, or AttachThreadInput to manage window focus and ensure inputs are directed correctly.
Video Switching: Depending on the sophistication, it might involve DDC/CI commands or other protocols to control monitor input sources, though purely software KVMs often rely on remote desktop protocols or separate monitor inputs. 

üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing & Enhancements
Contributions to kvmswitch are highly valuable! GitHub Docs states that well-defined contribution guidelines help create a thriving open-source community. Given the nature of C++ and system-level programming, your expertise can significantly enhance this project. 
If you are interested in contributing, consider:
Cross-Platform Support: Expanding the codebase to support other operating systems like Linux or macOS.
Advanced Switching Logic: Implementing more sophisticated switching methods, such as moving the mouse to the edge of the screen to switch focus (as seen in tools like Barrier or InputLeap).
Peripheral & Audio Sharing: Adding support for sharing other USB devices or audio between computers.
Performance & Stability: Optimizing the code for even faster input redirection and improving robustness in various network conditions.
Clipboard Sharing: Implementing seamless copy-paste functionality between connected machines.
User Interface Development: Developing a more feature-rich and user-friendly GUI for configuration and control.
